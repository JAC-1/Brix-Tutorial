1. From `クラス情報設定`, click the third button `コース実施画面`
2. From the drop-down menu, find the course (learning materials) you would like to set-up
3. click the `ユニット表示` button on the far right
4. Each unit is displayed in order 
5. If the list is too long, you can shorten it by using the second drop down menu 
6. Once you have a list you can work with, click the calendar icon for the respective unit and choose the start and end date for each unit 
7. Once you are finished, click the `登録` button near the bottom of the page

<h4 style="font-weight: bold; color: red;"> Note: If you don't set a due date, or a start date, the student will be able to start the section / unit anytime they want.</h4>


### Adding Goals

The Brix system requires goals for each course/learning material you selected. The _Goals_ page is split into two goals, one for 'completion' or 'progress' and other for 'grades'.

#### Progress Goal

1. Again from your `クラス情報設定` page, click on `公式目標設定`
2. At the top of the page, click the calendar button and choose the end date for your course
3. Bellow that, put the desired percentage of completion you would like your students to achieve (eg. 100 for 100% of the course completed)
4. Click the `すべて選択` button to select all the units/parts of the learning material, then move on to the next part


#### Grade Goal

1. Just like you did for the progress goal, choose the end date you want your students to achieve their grade / score / result goal
2. In the box bellow the date, type in the passing grade for the course 
3. The drop down box to the left of the 'point' box is where you can choose between `平均` (cumulative average) or 最低 (minimum score). I (Justin) assume that 'cumulative average' will average a range of grades, some low some high, whereas the minimum score measurement won’t mark a unit as **passed** unless they meet the minimum requirement for each part. 
4. Just like setting the Progress Goal, click `すべて選択` to select all the units
5. Finally click the `登録` button and all the red pop-up buttons
