<h4 style="font-weight: bold; color: red;"> Note: If you don't set a due date, or a start date, the student will be able to start the section / unit anytime they want.</h4>


### Adding Goals

The Brix system requires goals for each course/learning material you selected. The _Goals_ page is split into two goals, one for 'completion' or 'progress' and other for 'grades'.

#### Progress Goal

1. Again from your クラス情報設定 page, click on 公式目標設定
2. At the top of the page, click the calendar button and choose the end date for your course
3. Bellow that, put the desired percentage of completion you would like your students to achieve (eg. 100 for 100% of the course completed)
4. Click the すべて選択 button to select all the units/parts of the learning material, then move on to the next part


#### Grade Goal

1. Just like you did for the progress goal, choose the end date you want your students to achieve their grade / score / result goal
2. In the box bellow the date, type in the passing grade for the course 
3. The drop down box to the left of the 'point' box is where you can choose between 平均 (cumulative average) or 最低 (minimum score). I (Justin) assume that 'cumulative average' will average a range of grades, some low some high, whereas the minimum score measurement won’t mark a unit as **passed** unless they meet the minimum requirement for each part. 
4. Just like setting the Progress Goal, click すべて選択 to select all the units
5. Finally click the 登録 button and all the red pop-up buttons
