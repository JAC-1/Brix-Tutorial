4. Find the course you want and click the 選択 button
5. Click the　共有 button and accept the warning that pops up

### Adding Due Dates

The Brix system allows the teacher to time periods for when the student is able to do a particular moduel or section. 

The amount of sections and the section type (test, lesson, etc.) varries.

3. click the ユニット表示 button on the far right
4. Each unit is displayed in relative order

6. Once you have a list you can work with, click the calender icon for the respective unit and choose the start and end date for each unit 
7. Once you are finished, click the 登録 button near the bottom of the page


### Adding Goals

The Brix system requires goals for each course/learning material you selected.

#### Progress Goal

1. Again from your クラス情報設定 page, click on 公式目標設定
2. At the top of the page, click the calender button and choose the end date for your course
3. Bellow that, put the desired percentage of completion you would like your students to achieve (eg. 100 for 100% of the course completed)
4. Click the すべて選択 button to select all the units/parts of the learning material, then move on to the next part


#### Grade Goal

1. Just like you did for the progress goal, choose the end date you want your students to acheive their grade / score / result goal
2. In the box bellow the date, type in the percentage of correct answers you want your students to acheive
3. The drop down box to the left of the 'point' box is where you can choose 平均 (cumulative adverage) or 最低 (minimum score). I (Justin) assume that the fumulative adverage setting will accept a wide reange of fantastic and terrible grades. Whereas the minimum score measurement wont mark a unit as **passed** if they got a terrible grade on a specific unit
4. Simmilar to when you set the progress goal, click すべて選択 to select all the units
5. Finally click the 登録 button and click all the red pop-up buttons
