_there will be a warning that will pop-up. Don't worry, it just says "Oh by the way you only have the option of choosing two kinds of learning materials", but less gently_


3. You will see all available learning materials 
4. Find the course you want and click the 選択 button
5. Click the　共有 button and accept the warning that pops up

### Adding Due Dates

The Brix system allows the teacher to time periods for when the student can do a particular module or section. 

The number of sections and the section type (test, lesson, etc.) varies.

1. From クラス情報設定, click the third button コース実施画面
2. From the drop-down menu, find the course (learning materials) you would like to set-up
3. click the ユニット表示 button on the far right
4. Each unit is displayed in relative order
5. If the list is too long, you can shorten it by using the second drop down menu next to the drop-down menu you used to select the learning materials
6. Once you have a list you can work with, click the calendar icon for the respective unit and choose the start and end date for each unit 
7. Once you are finished, click the 登録 button near the bottom of the page

### Adding Goals

The Brix system requires goals for each course/learning material you selected.

#### Progress Goal

1. Again from your クラス情報設定 page, click on 公式目標設定
2. At the top of the page, click the calendar button and choose the end date for your course
3. Bellow that, put the desired percentage of completion you would like your students to achieve (eg. 100 for 100% of the course completed)
4. Click the すべて選択 button to select all the units/parts of the learning material, then move on to the next part


#### Grade Goal

1. Just like you did for the progress goal, choose the end date you want your students to achieve their grade / score / result goal
2. In the box bellow the date, type in the percentage of correct answers you want your students to achieve
3. The drop down box to the left of the 'point' box is where you can choose 平均 (cumulative average) or 最低 (minimum score). I (Justin) assume that the cumulative average setting will accept a wide range of fantastic and terrible grades. Whereas the minimum score measurement won’t mark a unit as **passed** if they got a terrible grade on a specific unit
4. Similar to when you set the progress goal, click すべて選択 to select all the units
5. Finally click the 登録 button and click all the red pop-up buttons
